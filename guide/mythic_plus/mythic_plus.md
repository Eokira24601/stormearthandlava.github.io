Information on this page is written with the assumption that you understand the new priority list, talents, and legendary items introduced in Shadowlands. If you have not done so, we highly recommend reading our other resources to learn about them!

This guide is intended to help you identify critical mobs and abilities as well as improve your mechanical literacy in using your toolkit as an Elemental Shaman in each dungeon. If you have any feedback about this guide, please feel welcome to reach out to the team!

# Talents and Legendaries

For novice Elemental Shamans without an active [Tier Set Bonus](https://www.wowhead.com/item-set=1499/theurgic-starspeakers-regalia) or without [Unity](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=364738/unity), the setup below is great for players starting out as well as for +15 keys and beyond:

* **15:** {{ site.data.talent.echo_of_the_elements }}
* **25:** {{ site.data.talent.aftershock }}
* **30:** {{ site.data.talent.spirit_wolf }} **or** {{ site.data.talent.static_charge }}
* **35:** {{ site.data.talent.master_of_the_elements }} **or** {{ site.data.talent.storm_elemental }}
* **40:** {{ site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance }} **or** {{ site.data.talent.natures_guardian }}
* **45:** {{ site.data.talent.primal_elementalist }}
* **50:** {{ site.data.talent.stormkeeper }}
* **Legendary:** {{ site.data.legendary.eogs }} **or** {{ site.data.legendary.night_fae }}

**Double Legendary**
When [Unity](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=364738/unity) is equipped you will be able to utilise 2 Legendary effects, one of them will be your current Covenant's specific Legendary:
* Night Fae gains {{ site.data.legendary.night_fae }}
* Venthyr gains {{ site.data.legendary.venthyr }}
* Kyrian gains {{ site.data.legendary.kyrian }}
* Necrolord gains {{ site.data.legendary.necrolord }}
This opens up some opportunities for M+ in conjuction with the [Tier Set](https://www.wowhead.com/item-set=1499/theurgic-starspeakers-regalia) centred around the uptime of {{ site.data.talent.se }}.
* Necrolord with {{ site.data.legendary.skybreaker }}
* Venthyr with {{ site.data.legendary.skybreaker }}
* Kyrian with {{ site.data.legendary.eogs }} judging Legendaries by their raw strength, {{ site.data.legendary.eogs }} and {{ site.data.legendary.kyrian }} are our strongest choices. Being able to use them both together is promising.
      
These setups will fluctuate in value depending on how keys are routed and which [Encrypted Affix](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/encrypted-affix-shadowlands-mythic-plus-season-3-automata-buffs) are utilised, and it is worth noting that Increased Cooldown Rate and similar effects are only useful if they enable uptime that you do not achieve in another manner - this should be kept in mind when deciding which setup to experiment with!

**Which setup to use?**
Whilst more experimenting may need to be done with [Encrypted Affix](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/encrypted-affix-shadowlands-mythic-plus-season-3-automata-buffs) and the builds noted above, the default suggestion when you have both [Unity](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=364738/unity) and [Tier Set](https://www.wowhead.com/item-set=1499/theurgic-starspeakers-regalia) will be to use the 9.2 version of our previous build:
* Night Fae with {{ site.data.legendary.eogs }} and {{ site.data.talent.se }}

This serves as a solid baseline without relying too much on how your dungeons are routed, or which [Encrypted Affix](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/encrypted-affix-shadowlands-mythic-plus-season-3-automata-buffs) buffs you gain. The performance will vary between the setups on a variety of factors so it is **very** valuable to experiment! 

The recommended Covenant choice for M+ content is Night Fae, so your Soulbind choices are:
* Korayn for {{ site.data.soulbinds.first_strike }}. This provides a large amount of value across an entire dungeon.
* Dreamweaver for {{ site.data.soulbinds.field_of_blossom }}. This provides additional power directly after using {{ site.data.spell.fae_transfusion }} and has synergy with {{ site.data.legendary.night_fae }} allowing for more frequent burst windows applicable to both AoE and Single Target.

To assist those experimenting with other Covenant options:
* Kyrian
    - Forgelite Prime Mikanikos for {{ site.data.soulbinds.hammer_of_genesis }} and [Effusive Anima Accelerator](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=352188/effusive-anima-accelerator?spellModifier=137038).
* Venthyr
    - When using {{ site.data.legendary.skybreakers }} the value of {{ site.data.soulbind.wasteland_propriety }} increases making it worthwhile to experiment with Theotar the Mad Duke!
    - Otherwise using Nadja the Mistblade.
* Necrolord
    - Plague Deviser Marileth with either [Ooz's Frictionless Coating](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=323091/oozs-frictionless-coating) for defense *or* {{ site.data.soulbind.preemptive_strike }} for reliable offensive value. 
    - Bonesmith Heirmir provides excellent value on sustained AoE so can also be considered as appropriate depending on your situation.

# Miscellaneous Tips

* Although strategies are listed for mobs and bosses, communicating with your group how each pull should be executed is more important. Some suggestions may not be applicable depending on your group's strategy.

* {{ site.data.spell.earth_elemental }} is a potent ability best used to soak damage away from the tank or as an emergency button to avoid a party wipe. Communicate with your tank on using {{ site.data.spell.earth_elemental }} for challenging trash packs as well as remind your healer to keep the {{ site.data.spell.earth_elemental }} healthy as needed. Remember that with {{ site.data.talent.primal_elementalist }}, you can manually move the pet, and you have access to an additional defensive with {{ site.data.spell.harden_skin}} and single-target stun with {{ site.data.spell.pulverize }}. However, keep in mind that you cannot have {{ site.data.spell.earth_elemental }} and {{ site.data.spell.fire_elemental }} summoned at the same time with {{ site.data.talent.primal_elementalist }}.

* Often times, your tank may need to kite. Remember the kiting tools at your disposal ({{ site.data.spell.earthbind_totem }}, {{ site.data.spell.frost_shock }}, {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }}, {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }}) to distance trash packs away from your tank.

* Routinely support your healer and your group with healing abilities and {{ site.data.spell.cleanse_spirit }}. Note that the healers that cannot remove Curses are: Discipline Priest, Holy Priest, Holy Paladin, and Mistweaver Monk.

* Plan with your group in advance on where to use {{ site.data.spell.bloodlust }}.

* [Learn to log your dungeon runs!](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/help/start) Warcraft Logs filters dungeons with pull-by-pull analyses and records replays of dungeon runs. Having logs available to share are helpful for you to receive actionable feedback.

# Affixes

**Level 4:**

* [Bolstering](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=7/bolstering): Damage trash packs down as evenly as you can. Swap to priority damage rotation for any lethal mobs or if mob health within trash packs are uneven.
* [Bursting](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=11/bursting): Support your party members and use your healing abilities to mitigate the [Bursting](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=11/bursting) debuff. Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed if stacks are high.
* [Inspiring](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=122/inspiring): Crowd control mobs with [Inspiring Presence](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=343502/inspiring-presence) with {{ site.data.spell.hex }} as needed and when possible.
* [Raging](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=6/raging): Be ready to use your kiting toolkit to support your tank when needed. Consider using {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }} and {{ site.data.talent.stormkeeper }} to finish [Raging](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=6/raging) mobs more safely and quickly.
* [Sanguine](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=8/sanguine): Damage trash packs down as evenly as you can to lessen time spent in Sanguine, but be sure to not slow or stun mobs dying unevenly. Use {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }} as needed to knock mobs out of [Sanguine](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=8/sanguine).
* [Spiteful](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=123/spiteful): As mobs are dying, be ready to use your kiting toolkit to support your melee players. Consider taking advantage of [Spiteful Shade](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/npc=174773/spiteful-shade) as additional {{ site.data.spell.chain_lightning }} or {{ site.data.spell.flame_shock }} targets.

**Level 7:**

* [Explosive](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=13/explosive): [Explosive](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=13/explosive) orbs can be destroyed in a single {{ site.data.spell.frost_shock }} global. This will be your most efficient tool to deal with them as your other abilities are more valuable for trash.
* [Grievous](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=12/grievous): Remember that direct heals remove one stack of [Grievous Wound](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=240559/grievous-wound). Support your party members with {{ site.data.spell.healing_surge }} and {{ site.data.spell.chain_heal }} as needed.
* [Necrotic](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=4/necrotic): Be ready to use your kiting toolkit to support your tank when needed. {{ site.data.spell.earth_elemental }} is also helpful to help your tank control [Necrotic Wound](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=209858/necrotic-wound) stacks.
* [Quaking](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=14/quaking): Maintain your distance from party members, and be mindful about canceling casts if [Quake](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=240447/quake) overlaps with {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }}.
* [Storming](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=124/storming): Maintain your distance from mobs to avoid [Storming](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=124/storming). Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} as needed in tight spaces or when maneuvering any mechanics.
* [Volcanic](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=3/volcanic): Watch your feet. Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} as needed to maintain your damage uptime while avoiding [Volcanic](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/affix=3/volcanic) plumes.

**Seasonal Affix:**

* Encrypted: [Encrypted](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/encrypted-affix-shadowlands-mythic-plus-season-3-automata-buffs) is the Season 3 Affix for Shadowlands. Groups of relics are present in packs throughout dungeons, including relics with every boss! Pick which relic to kill first to decide which Elite Automa will spawn! When an Elite Automa dies, your group is empowered with their buff! 

* [Urh Dismantler](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=184911/urh-dismantler) spawns when [Urh Relic](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=185685/urh-relic) is killed first.
    * [Urh Relic](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=185685/urh-relic) has [Deconstruct](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=366297/deconstruct) and [Force Slam](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=366288/force-slam) abilities. 
    * Make sure to move from [Force Slam's](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=366288/force-slam) targeting circle! 
    * When killed your group receives [Decrypted Urh Cypher](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=368239/decrypted-urh-cypher) granting 200% increased spell and ability cooldown rate and restoring 10% health and mana per second for 10 seconds.

* [Wo Drifter](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=184910/wo-drifter) spawns when [Wo Relic](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=185683/wo-relic) is killed first. 
    * [Wo Relic](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=185683/wo-relic) has one ability: [Burst](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=366566/burst) which should be interrupted using {{ site.data.spell.wind_shear }}, coordinate with your group to ensure no [Burst](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=366566/burst) casts go through! 
    * When killed your group receives [Decrypted Wo Cypher](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=368241/decrypted-wo-cypher) granting 150% increased movement speed, 15% reduced damage taken for 1 minute. In addition, when not in combat players with [Decrypted Wo Cypher](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=368241/decrypted-wo-cypher) will gain a stealth effect!

* [Vy Interceptor](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=184908/vy-interceptor) spawns when [Vy Relic](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=185680/vy-relic) is killed first. 
    * [Vy Relic](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=185680/vy-relic) has two abilities: [Shoot](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=366406/shoot) and [Fusion Beam](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=366409/fusion-beam). 
    * [Fusion Beam](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=366409/fusion-beam) is targeted at a player's location, so spreading slightly during the pull **if that will not cause other issues** can help reduce movement required to dodge [Fusion Beam](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=366409/fusion-beam).
    * When killed your group receives [Decrypted Vy Cypher](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=368240/decrypted-vy-cypher) granting 15% increase Haste and summons an `Orb of Energy` which grants players a chance to deal additional damage or healing on their abilities, depending on role.

* Recommendations:
    * All three effects have merit and the value of their contribution will vary by your group composition, routing decisions, and key level.
    * Given the nature of [Elemental's Tier Set](https://www.wowhead.com/item-set=1499/theurgic-starspeakers-regalia) the increased spell and ability cooldown rate from [Decrypted Urh Cypher](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=368239/decrypted-urh-cypher) could have intriguing results when the Tier is active.
    * It is generally thought that [Vy Interceptor](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=184908/vy-interceptor) is harder to deal with due to [Fusion Beam](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=366409/fusion-beam) causing it to teleport away. So of the two effects that directly contribute to damage dealt, [Decrypted Urh Cypher](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=368239/decrypted-urh-cypher) and [Decrypted Vy Cypher](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=368240/decrypted-vy-cypher), it may be the case that groups kill [Urh Relic](https://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=185685/urh-relic) because it is easier to deal with. 
    * Properly selecting which buff you would *like* to have is one thing, your group killing the 'correct' `Relic` first is another! The state of the buffs being granted means it is highly unlikely for accidental `Relic` kills to be the reason your group does or not does successfully time or complete the key, assuming `+15` or lower. Beyond that level your mileage may vary!

          <div class="card-body" markdown="1">  

**Enraged Spirit**

* {{ site.data.mythic_plus.rage }} is dangerous when Fortified. Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} or healing abilities as needed.
* {{ site.data.mythic_plus.enraged_mask }} can be despawned with crowd control, so utilize {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }} when they appear.

**Risen Cultist**

* Rotate interrupts between {{ site.data.mythic_plus.scribe }} and {{ site.data.mythic_plus.dark_lotus }}.

**Death Speaker**

* Rotate interrupts between {{ site.data.mythic_plus.deaths_embrace }} and {{ site.data.mythic_plus.shadowcore }}. If a {{ site.data.mythic_plus.deaths_embrace }} cast goes off, {{ site.data.spell.purge }} it.

**Atal'ai Devoted**

* Consider these mobs the priority target in any pack they're in, killing them before {{ site.data.mythic_plus.devoted_sacrifice }} goes off. Use {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }}, {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }}, or {{ site.data.spell.hex }} to briefly stop their cast.

**Atal'ai High Priest**

* Rotate interrupts between {{ site.data.mythic_plus.heal }} and {{ site.data.mythic_plus.smite }}.

**Atal'ai Hoodoo Hexxer**

* Rotate interrupts between {{ site.data.mythic_plus.healing_wave }}, {{ site.data.mythic_plus.hex }}, and {{ site.data.mythic_plus.lightning_discharge }}.

**Atal'ai Deathwalker**

* Use {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }} to hard cancel their {{ site.data.mythic_plus.bladestorm }}. When these mobs die, they turn into an Atal'ai Deathwalker's Spirit with {{ site.data.mythic_plus.spectral }}, which you can {{ site.data.spell.purge }} to instantly kill them.

## Hakkar the Soulflayer

* {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} has many uses cases here: for {{ site.data.mythic_plus.blood_nova }} if the Son of Hakkar adds are out of control, for {{ site.data.mythic_plus.corrupted_blood }}, or for {{ site.data.mythic_plus.blood_barrier }} to minimize the value of the absorb.
* Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} as needed to avoid {{ site.data.mythic_plus.blood_barrage }}.

---

**Defunct Dental Drill**

* {{ site.data.mythic_plus.haywire }} is dangerous when Fortified, but a common tactic is to just line-of-sight this.

* Interrupt {{ site.data.mythic_plus.discharge }}.
* Hard cancel their {{ site.data.mythic_plus.spinning_up }} with {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }}.
* If no stuns are available, use {{ site.data.spell.earthbind_totem }} and {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }} as needed to keep these mobs away from your party. If these mobs are still too close for comfort, {{ site.data.mythic_plus.additional_threads }} can be {{ site.data.spell.purge }}d.

**Volatile Memory**

* These mobs will self-destruct on their own with {{ site.data.mythic_plus.volatile_capacitor }}. Use {{ site.data.spell.earthbind_totem }} as needed to keep them away from your party.

**Lubricator**

* Rotate interrupts between {{ site.data.mythic_plus.lubricate }} and {{ site.data.mythic_plus.self_cleaning_cycle }}.

**Sentient Oil**

* Interrupt {{ site.data.mythic_plus.essential_oil }}.

## The Manastorms

When Millhouse is active:

* Interrupt {{ site.data.mythic_plus.frostbolt }}.
* Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed when soaking {{ site.data.mythic_plus.power_overwhelming }} or for {{ site.data.mythic_plus.diabolical_dooooooom }}
* Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} as needed to position {{ site.data.mythic_plus.echo_finger_laser_x_treme }}.

When Millificent is active:

* Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed for {{ site.data.mythic_plus.aerial_rocket_chicken_barrage }}.
* Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} as needed to disarm {{ site.data.mythic_plus.experimental_squirrel_bomb }}s or position {{ site.data.mythic_plus.shadowfury }} on the boss. {{ site.data.mythic_plus.experimental_squirrel_bomb }} can be disarmed while in motion.

---

**Weald Shimmermoth**

* Party members should be jumping to remove {{ site.data.mythic_plus.soporific_shimmerdust }}. If your party members aren't jumping, this can be dispelled with {{ site.data.spell.cleanse_spirit }}. If your party members do end up falling asleep from this debuff, {{ site.data.spell.tremor_totem }} can also be used to dispel it.

**Spriggan Barkbinder**

* Interrupt {{ site.data.mythic_plus.bark_armor }}. If this cast goes off, {{ site.data.spell.purge }} it.

**Mythresh, Sky's Talons**

* Cast {{ site.data.spell.tremor_totem }} for {{ site.data.mythic_plus.wailing_grief }} to quickly dispel any players caught by the Fear.

**Bladebeak Hatchling**

* {{ site.data.mythic_plus.frightened_cries }} will aggro nearby Bladebeak Matriarchs and Territorial Bladebeaks which may cause your pull to go out of hand. Use {{ site.data.spell.hex }} or {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }} to hard cancel this ability.

## Dealer Xy'exa

* Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed for {{ site.data.mythic_plus.arcane_lightning }} or {{ site.data.mythic_plus.localized_explosive_contrivance }}.
* Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} when launched to the air from {{ site.data.mythic_plus.displacement_trap }} or as needed to transfer {{ site.data.mythic_plus.arcane_lightning }} to another party member.

---

## Mueh'zala

* Hold your cooldowns for the Shattered Visage add from {{ site.data.mythic_plus.shatter_reality }}.
* The DoT from {{ site.data.mythic_plus.cosmic_artifice }} will be the highest source of damage taken. Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed.
* Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} as needed to avoid Master of Death.

**Depraved Houndmaster**

* {{ site.data.mythic_plus.loyal_beasts }} enrage the Vicious Gargons, and {{ site.data.mythic_plus.rapid_fire }} is dangerous when Fortified. You can hard cancel these abilities with {{ site.data.spell.hex }} or {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }}.

**Depraved Obliterator**

* Rotate interrupts between {{ site.data.mythic_plus.curse_of_obliteration }} and {{ site.data.mythic_plus.wicked_bolt }}. If a {{ site.data.mythic_plus.curse_of_obliteration }} cast goes off, dispel with {{ site.data.spell.cleanse_spirit }}.

**Depraved Collector**

* Interrupt {{ site.data.mythic_plus.collect_sins }}.

**Shard of Halkias**

* Stand at max range to avoid {{ site.data.mythic_plus.thrash }} entirely. Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} if absolutely needed.

## Halkias, the Sin-Stained Goliath

* Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} during {{ site.data.mythic_plus.refracted_sinlight }}.
* If any party members are outside the {{ site.data.mythic_plus.light_of_atonement }} aura and Feared by {{ site.data.mythic_plus.sinlight_visions }}, use {{ site.data.spell.tremor_totem }}.

---

**Stoneborn Reaver**

* Interrupt {{ site.data.mythic_plus.turn_to_stone}}. If a cast goes off, {{ site.data.spell.purge }} it.

## Echelon

* Hold {{ site.data.talent.stormkeeper }} for the Undying Stonefiend add spawn. Undying Stonefiends will not begin casting until they are hit with damage, so wait for them to congregate around the boss before engaging. Interrupt their {{ site.data.mythic_plus.villainous_bolt }} cast, and use {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }} and {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }} as needed to control them.
* Keep some distance from the Undying Stonefiends due to {{ site.data.mythic_plus.volatile_transformation }}.
* {{ site.data.mythic_plus.curse_of_stone }} can be dispelled with {{ site.data.spell.cleanse_spirit }}. Prioritize dispelling party members targeted by {{ site.data.mythic_plus.stone_shattering_leap }} or any other party members at risk, and dispelled players will be able to avoid damage if they run away quickly. Othrewise, use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} for {{ site.data.mythic_plus.stone_shattering_leap }} and {{ site.data.mythic_plus.shattered }} as needed.

---

## High Adjudicator Aleez

---

**Drust Spiteclaw**

* {{ site.data.spell.purge }} {{ site.data.mythic_plus.dying_breath }}. If these are not {{ site.data.spell.purge }}d and players are affected by {{ site.data.mythic_plus.dying_breath }}, you can dispel them with {{ site.data.spell.cleanse_spirit }}.

**Drust Harvester**

* Rotate interrupts between {{ site.data.mythic_plus.harvest_essence }} and {{ site.data.mythic_plus.spirit_bolt }}.

**Drust Boughbreaker**

* When these mobs reach 50% health, they will channel {{ site.data.mythic_plus.furious_thrashing }} which is dangerous when Fortified. Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} or healing abilities as needed.
* If you move as the {{ site.data.mythic_plus.bramble_burst }} cast finishes, you can avoid the initial damage.

* Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} as needed when dodging the mechanics from {{ site.data.mythic_plus.might_of_maldraxxus }} ({{ site.data.mythic_plus.crushing_slam }}, {{ site.data.mythic_plus.massive_cleave }}, {{ site.data.mythic_plus.deafening_crash }}). Don't be caught casting when Xav is casting {{ site.data.mythic_plus.deafening_crash }}; the interrupt effect still applies even when you are out of the circle.

**Nefarious Darkspeaker**

* Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} as needed to avoid {{ site.data.mythic_plus.death_winds }}.

* Interrupt {{ site.data.mythic_plus.spirit_frost }}.

## Kul'tharok

* Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} as needed to maneuver {{ site.data.mythic_plus.draw_soul }}. Position yourself on the {{ site.data.mythic_plus.grasping_hands }} so your Soul is rooted in it to catch it quickly.
* Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed when you are Soulless or you have the {{ site.data.mythic_plus.phantasmal_parasite }} debuff.

## Mordretha, the Endless Empress

* Stay near the boss in anticipation for {{ site.data.mythic_plus.dark_devastation }} to quickly avoid it.
* Consider holding Stormkeeper for Deathwalkers if necessary. Use {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }} as needed when they are grouped up.
* {{ site.data.mythic_plus.grasping_rift }} and {{ site.data.mythic_plus.manifest_death }} often overlap. Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} for this combo as needed.
* If any party members fail to run away from {{ site.data.mythic_plus.grasping_rift }}, dispel {{ site.data.mythic_plus.death_grasp }} with {{ site.data.spell.cleanse_spirit }}.
* When the boss is at 50% health, she will begin casting {{ site.data.mythic_plus.echos_of_carnage }}. This ability will passively be your highest source of damage taken (even when dodging the ghost animations), so use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} at this point as needed.
