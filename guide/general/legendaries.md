## TL;DR Recommendations
- {{ site.data.legendary.windspeaker }} for Single Target
- {{ site.data.legendary.eogs }} for M+ and stacked AoE
- {{ site.data.legendary.night_fae }} for M+ and stacked AoE (until [Unity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=190595/memory-of-unity) is available)
- {{ site.data.legendary.skybreaker }} for Spread Cleave

For more information on M+ setups see the [M+ Section](http://stormearthandlava.com/guide/mythic_plus/mythic_plus.html).


The following charts show the value of specific Legendaries in single target and AoE situations. Use this as a general guide, but don't treat it as gospel. Remember that different legendaries are propped up by different sets of stats and talents and the charts are simmed with a constant set of gear and talents.
